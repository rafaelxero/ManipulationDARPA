\section{Conclusions}
	\label{sec:conclusions}
	
	The task-level teleoperation strategy presented in this paper was successfully applied
	to the HRP-2Kai humanoid robot, which was able to carry out all the manipulation tasks
	proposed for the DRC, even though there was no accurate model of the environment.
	Our principal restriction was the time limit, considering that most of the time spent
	during the task was the one required by the manual identification of the objects in the
	environment and by the verification of the robot motion by the operator.
	
	With respect to the plug task it is worth to notice that even though its execution
	lasted 16:34 minutes, the effective time was just 1:34 and the number of adjustments
	required to insert the plug was only 3.
	This was the result of assuring a stable grasp of the plug, as well as the use of markers
	to identify the plug and the sockets.
	
	As a future work we want to improve our recognition system, in order to speed up the execution
	of every task.
