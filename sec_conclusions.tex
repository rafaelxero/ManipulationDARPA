\section{Conclusions}
	\label{sec:conclusions}
	
	With respect to the plug task it is worth to notice that even though its execution
	lasted 16:34 minutes, the effective time was just 1:34 and the number of adjustments
	required to insert the plug was only 3.
	This was the result of assuring a stable grasp of the plug by following the strategy
	explained before, as well as the use of markers to identify the plug and the sockets.
