\section{Conclusions}
	\label{sec:conclusions}
	
	With respect to the plug task it is worth to notice that even though its execution
	lasted about 16 and a half minutes due to recognition, verification and blackouts,
	the number of slight adjustments required to insert the plug was only 3.
	This was the result of assuring a stable grasp by following the strategy explained
	before, as well as the use of a reference representing the target socket.
	Other teams that chose to grasp the cable instead of the plug itself required between
	8 and 14 adjustments in order to complete the insertion.
