\section{HRP-2Kai humanoid robot}
	\label{sec:hrp2kai}
	
	HRP-2Kai stands for Humanoid Robotics Platform no.~2 Improved (Kai means improvement in Japanese).
	This humanoid was developed in phase two of the Japanese national project HRP
	(Humanoid Robotics Project) and was recently improved to be able to cope with disaster response
	tasks~\cite{Kaneko}.
	
	This robot, depicted in \figurename~\ref{fig:HRP2Kai-robot}, has the kinematic structure shown
	in \figurename~\ref{fig:HRP2Kai-structure}.
	As seen in this diagram, the robot has 32 dof:
	6 at each leg, 2 at the waist, two at the head, 7 at each arm and 1 at each hand.
	This robot features a set of exteroceptive sensors that are actively used during the manipulation
	tasks: force sensors on its wrists, a 3D scanner system built in its head and four cameras,
	placed at the head, at the back and at each hand.
	The 3D scanner system was implemented with a Laser Range Finder (LRF) synchronized with the head
	pitch joint, as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:3DScanner}.
	The hand camera is mounted in each hand as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:Hand}, together with a
	LED light and a laser.
	It is worth to mention that this camera is not lined up with the longitudinal axis of the hand.

	% Have to check the following paragraph

        HRP-2Kai is equipped with six-axis force sensors on its wrists and ankles. The wrist force sensors 
        were used for task control, specifically to detect hand contact with the environment as expressed in 
        Sections V.C and VI.C. The ankle force sensors were used for biped walk stabilization.
