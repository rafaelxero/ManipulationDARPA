	\begin{abstract}
		This paper presents the method used by our team, AIST-NEDO, at the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) to deal with
		the requested manipulation tasks by means of a task-level teleoperation, by considering a degraded communication
		between the user and the robot and that the environment was not known in advance.
		The method basically consists on the use of 3D models of objects (from now on referred as ``markers'') which,
		once aligned with the actual attitude of the real objects that they represent, provide a reference frame in
		which the motion can be described, in order to successfully realize a manipulation task in a non-structured
		environment.
		These markers can represent the object being manipulated, some reference object in the environment and the
		hands of the robot.
		This method is illustrated by means of describing three representative tasks (which where requested during the DRC)
		and presenting the corresponding results obtained during the competition.
