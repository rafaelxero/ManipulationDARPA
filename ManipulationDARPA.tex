	\begin{abstract}
		This paper presents the strategy used by our team, AIST-NEDO, at the DARPA Robotics Challenge to deal
		with the designated manipulation tasks by means of a task-level teleoperation of the HRP-2Kai humanoid robot,
		considering a disaster-hit scenario that is inherently non-structured and a limited communication between the
		user and the robot.
		The strategy, based on the information provided by a laser rangefinder and a set of cameras installed
		at the head and at both hands, consisted in the alignment of 3D models representing the desired manipulation
		targets with a measured point cloud, in order to provide a reference frame to describe the manipulation motion
		required for each task.
		Each motion was carefully planned in advance by assuming minimum information of the object representing the
		manipulation target.
		In order to exemplify the before mentioned approach, two representative tasks of the DARPA Robotics Challenge
		are described, as well as the corresponding results obtained during the competition.
